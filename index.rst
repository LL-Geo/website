Fatiando a Terra (Portuguese for *Slicing the Earth*) is an open-source
Python_ toolkit for **modeling and inversion in geophysics**.

Fatiando provides:

* A way to **integrate geophysical modeling**: functions operate on a
  common data and model format so that different methods can be
  interchanged and linked together
* Easily **prototyping inversion** methods using the
  `fatiando.inversion`_ package of inverse problem solvers
* A range of **toy problems** to help teach modeling and inverse
  problem concepts
* Easy **plotting** with matplotlib_ and 3D
  plotting with Mayavi_
* **Fast** routines, courtesy of Numpy_ and Cython_
* A free (as in beer) and **open-source** alternative to commercial
  software

The Cookbook_ has examples of what Fatiando can already do.

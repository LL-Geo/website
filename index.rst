.. title:: Fatiando a Terra

An open source toolkit for modeling and inversion in geophysics
===============================================================

Fatiando a Terra (Portuguese for *Slicing the Earth*)
provides an easy and flexible way to perform common tasks like:
generating synthetic data, forward modeling, inversion, 3D visualization,
and more.
All from inside the powerful Python_ language.

* **Integrate geophysical modeling**: functions operate on a
  common data and model format so that different methods can be
  interchanged and linked together
* Easily **prototyping inversion** methods using the
  `fatiando.inversion`_ package of inverse problem solvers
* A range of **toy problems** to help teach modeling and inverse
  problem concepts
* Easy **plotting** by wrapping matplotlib_ and Mayavi_
* **Fast** routines, courtesy of Numpy_ and Cython_
* A free (as in beer) and **open-source** alternative to commercial
  software

The Cookbook_ has examples of what Fatiando can already do.

Announcements
=============

* **July 2014**: We presented a poster at Scipy 2014 about the
  ``fatiando.inversion`` package. See the
  `Github repo <https://github.com/leouieda/scipy2014>`__ for the poster and
  source code behind it.

* **June 2013**: Fatiando a Terra was presented at SciPy 2013.
  `Slides and source code <https://github.com/leouieda/scipy2013>`__
  of the presentation and proceedings are on Github.
